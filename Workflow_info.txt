Branches:
    1. master: we only use this for each release.
    2. dev: this is the main branch for all changes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Typical workflow:
    A. Make some changes in the 'dev' branch.
        A.1. Most of changes can be directly done over the 'dev' branch.
        A.2. In some cases, one can create a new branch from 'dev', say 'new_sampling', and when
        its results is satisfactory, the 'new_sampling' branch can be merged into the 'dev' branch.
    B. When we want to release a new version:
        B.1. we first need to run all tests in dev and make sure that all tests pass.
        B.2. then we can merge 'dev' into 'master'.
        B.3. when we push the 'master' branch, all pipelines will generate the docs and push them
        to the server.

Notes:
    * We can consider the 'dev' branch as our main development branch.
    * We can consider the 'master' branch as our release branch.
